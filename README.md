Just to locate a missing Iphone
This web-based tracking application helps users locate their iPhone using iCloud credentials or IMEI. Built with Python, Streamlit, and Google Maps integration, the app fetches real-time location data via pyicloud_ipd and findmy libraries. It displays the phoneâ€™s exact location, IMEI, and serial number on an interactive map.

Key features include real-time tracking, 2FA authentication handling, and an attempt to turn on location services remotely if the device is offline. The project is designed for enhanced device security and recovery.
